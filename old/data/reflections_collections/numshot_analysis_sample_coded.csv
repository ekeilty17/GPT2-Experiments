If you take too little nicotine, you will be unable to control your urge to smoke. On the other hand, if you take too much nicotine, you may become addicted to nicotine and lose all motivation to quit. The best way to determine whether you need more nicotine is to use an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette). Electronic cigarettes deliver nicotine through inhalation of vaporized liquid that contains no tobacco. They also contain flavorings such as fruit flavors, mints, menthol, and chocolate. E-cigarettes can help smokers who cannot quit because they find it difficult to focus while trying to hold their breath for long periods of time.

It started as an alternative way to get high. People used tobacco because they didn't have access to other drugs such as alcohol or marijuana. They also smoked because it gave them a sense of control over their lives. Nowadays we know that smoking causes cancer, heart disease, emphysema, lung diseases, strokes, respiratory infections, and many more problems. We are all aware of these dangers so why do people continue to smoke? Why does anyone want to be associated with something that can kill them?
