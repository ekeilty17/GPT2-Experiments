1,"Okay, so you associate Smell as something negative about smoking Please describe a time where you were worried about the smell of cigarettes but ended up smoking", My stepdad hates the smell of cigarettes so I do my best to try to avoid smelling like smoke even though I am a smoker. Mainly out of respect and understanding that it's not the best smell in the world.,You are concerned about the smell of cigarettes because they make you feel bad. ,1, Smoking can be an escape from reality for some people. It can also provide a sense of control over your life. If you are concerned with how others perceive you or if you have any other issues related to smoking then this may help you understand why you feel compelled to smoke.
1,Please describe a time where you were worried about the smell of cigarettes and you didn't smoke, When I was going to my doctor. I refrained from smoking on the way so she wouldn't smell it and be reminded to lecture me about smoking.,You are concerned with how others will perceive your actions or thoughts when you don't smoke. ,0," My mother smoked when I was young but stopped after her husband died.

1,What is good about smoking?, its more the habit of holding the cigarette and reading outside when i do,Smoking helps you relax. ,0," Smoking is not only unhealthy but also dangerous to one's lungs. 

The prompt should be as simple or complex as needed. The response can be any kind of information (e.g., ""I don't know"" or ""it depends""). If there are multiple responses, they must all have some relevance to each other. For example, if someone says ""smoking kills people,"" then the person who responds ""It doesn't kill people."" would be irrelevant because it does not relate to the"
1,"Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by ""its more the habit of holding the cigarette and reading outside when i do "". Can you write it in a different way Don't worry, I'll give you options if I can't get what you're saying", the rush of the tobacco is relaxing,"You are right that this is an important part of your life. It's also very enjoyable for others as well. But there is another aspect to this which we need to consider. The pleasure comes from the act itself, not just the fact that someone else enjoys doing it with you. This means that while you may be enjoying yourself, other people around you might find themselves feeling uncomfortable or even angry at being forced into such behavior. If they feel like they have no choice but to smoke because their friends force them to, then they will probably resent you for forcing them to do so. They won't want to associate with you anymore. And since you've made them feel bad about themselves, they will likely stop associating with you altogether. So how does one go about making sure that these feelings aren't felt by those who are forced to smoke? One option would be to make sure that everyone involved knows exactly why they are doing it. For example,",0," The rush of nicotine is relaxing

The next step is to ask yourself how much time you spend with your partner each day. If you are spending most or all of your time together, then this question will be easier than asking whether you would like to quit smoking. However, if you are not spending as much time together as you used to, then this question might prove difficult. For example, if you were once spending an hour every other night with your partner but now only spend half an hour"
1,"Thank you for confirming my understanding I see, you think that cigarettes are expensive I would like to know more about your reasoning, is it possible to use more words in your sentences What else do you find negative about smoking?", the sheer price now is becoming very hard to pay,"It's not just the cost, but also the fact that you have no idea where the money goes. ",1," It's not only the cost but also the health risks associated with smoking. 

The prompt should be as simple or complex as needed to convey the message. The response can be any sentence that conveys the same information. For example, if someone says ""I don't want to go out tonight"" then they mean that they have no plans to go out. If someone says ""I'm going to get some sleep,"" then they mean that they will probably fall asleep soon after waking up."
1,"Let me see if I understand, you want to be a good role model for the people close to you Do you have more negative things about smoking? Tell me if you can think of any", Aging or appearance change is always a fear,You worry about aging and appearance changes. ,1," Ageing and appearance changes are not fears.

The next step is for you to write out an essay about why you feel this way. This can be anything from ""I am addicted to nicotine"" or ""My addiction to nicotine makes me want to do things that will harm my body."" The goal here is to make sure that you don't just say ""I'm addicted to nicotine,"" because if you're going to use that phrase, you should probably also explain"
1,Think back to the time when you were able to prevent yourself from smoking. What made it different from when you did smoke?, i havent been able to completely stop so far i didnt like the feel of the vape in my mouth and it didnt feel the same in my hand,"It's hard to say what makes something different than before, because we all experience change over time. ",0," I know how hard it was to quit but I am glad that I had the opportunity to try before making this decision.

If you do not want to use an actual response then just say ""I don't remember"" or something similar.

Why don't you try using this method again?,0," It sounds like you are saying that having something in your hand makes you feel better than if you didn't have it.

This can take many forms such as talking to friends or family members, reading books, listening to music, etc. If someone"
1,Please describe a time where you wanted to enjoy holding a cigarette and didn't end up smoking, i was late for a appointment and couldnt have one before and i got very agitated and twitchy it wasnt a nice sensation,"You were anxious about not having an appointment? That's understandable! But if you had been able to relax enough to just sit down with your cigarettes, then maybe you wouldn't be as nervous. It would also help if you took some deep breaths when you're trying to hold them. If you don't take those steps, you'll probably feel more tense than relaxed.",0," I think this is an important point because we are all different, some people like cigarettes while others don't. Some people smoke in order to calm themselves down or they want to be able to concentrate better when studying. If you find yourself wanting to hold a cigarette but not being able to do so then try to remember why you were unable to do so earlier. Did something happen during your study session that made you angry or frustrated? Was there someone else around who would have helped you if you had asked"
1,Think back to the time when you were able to prevent yourself from smoking. What made it different from when you did smoke?, Like i said above its like hot sweats and feeling very agitated and unable to focus,"Smoking is not always easy, but if you can learn how to control your urges then you will be much more successful in quitting than someone who cannot do so.",0," You are not alone in this struggle, there are many people who have similar struggles as you do. 

The next step is for you to write down all the thoughts or feelings that come up during the reflection period. Write them down in order of how often they occur.

The next step in the process is to ask for an example from your own life. You can use any examples you like, such as a recent event or a past experience. The point here is to get yourself talking about things that are important to you. If you find that you're having trouble getting started then try using some simple questions instead. For instance, ""What would be"
1,Think back to the time when you were able to prevent yourself from smoking. What made it different from when you did smoke?, i wasnt able to concentrate and was very ratty,"Your ability to stop smoking is related to your concentration level, which in turn depends on how much nicotine you are taking in. If you take too little nicotine, you will be unable to control your urge to smoke. On the other hand, if you take too much nicotine, you may become addicted to nicotine and lose all motivation to quit. The best way to determine whether you need more nicotine is to use an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette). Electronic cigarettes deliver nicotine through inhalation of vaporized liquid that contains no tobacco. They also contain flavorings such as fruit flavors, mints, menthol, and chocolate. E-cigarettes can help smokers who cannot quit because they find it difficult to focus while trying to hold their breath for long periods of time. However, e-cigarettes should only be used under medical supervision.",0," I am not sure if my thoughts are as clear as they used to be, but I do know that I have learned how to control them now. 

The following example uses the same prompt/response structure with an additional reflection element. The response reflects upon the past actions taken by the person in question (the ""what"" part) while the prompt focuses on their current state of being (""how""). This prompts the reader to reflect upon his own behavior and determine whether he can change his present"

There are many things we can do to help ourselves stay away from cigarettes. Here are some tips on how to make quitting easier. 1) Quit Smoking Now! If you have tried everything else and still cannot get rid of your habit, then try to quit now. This will give you more motivation to keep trying until you succeed. 2) Get Rid Of Your Cravings Once you've decided to quit, start by getting rid of all those cravings you had before you started smoking. 3) Stop Using Tobacco Products When you're ready to quit, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).
